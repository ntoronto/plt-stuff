Change Omega-Idx from Exact-Nonnegative-Rational to (Listof (U 0 1)) (build in reverse)
Find out why eq?-ness is sometimes not preserved, fix (for faster in-cache test)
Piecewise monotone R -> R functions (define `prim-if' for this?)
Piecewise monotone R x R -> R functions
Make sure DrBayes-level "let" is faster than manual substitution (when manual substitution retains meaning)
Try ray tracing
Custom data structures (for NLP tests)
Fail on measure-zero Ω, not just empty Ω
Log probabilities
Bootstrap sampling resamples point within Ω
