2D and 3D
---------
Start separate GUI event thread when opening window to show plots?

Parameterize default-range->ticks

Parameterize real-seq? (would allow logarithmic transform of renderers)

More color functions (contour, contour3d, surface3d, etc.)
Flexible: allow color, listof color, function of color, whenever any makes sense

Documentation

Test cases

Plot options:
Exclude axes

Legends

Compatibility layer

Test: polynomial at [big..big+epsilon] (support for exact rational functions)

Check all positive-integer/c contracts for value 1 (guess: divide by zero)

Remove all references to parameters in render functions (should be passed in upon renderer creation)

One tick function in a renderer (in case y ticks depend on x range, etc.)

Fix point label sizes when using string


3D only
-------
Precision problem in dc->plot/x-size, etc. (need to rotate but not translate)

Depth sorting
Bucket the sorted shapes and then sort by occlusion, default to min z first
Divide intersecting polygons?
Global subdivision parameter (plot3d-samples)

Graph types:
Histogram (vector a b height)
Isosurface
Concentric, transparent isosurfaces ("contour volumes"?)


2D only
-------
error-bars

Plot types:
Functions: filling under/between curves
1D KDE (using FFT!)
Parametric regions
Logarithmic (with adaptive or with parameterized subdivision, this could be a transform)
Polar and polar axes

Function extensions:
Detect and handle visible discontinuities?
Manually exclude discontinuous points?
Adaptive sampling?
Doc example: step function with discontinuities shown with circles?

Histogram changes:
Color function
histogram-list?

More 'points' symbols:
integers -1..127
5star
6star
full5star
