2D and 3D
---------
Fix memory leak!

plot2d, plot3d take variable number of arguments? or trees?

Start separate GUI event thread when opening window to show plots? Or was that a bug?

Map from integers to point symbols

Documentation

Merge common/transform.rkt and common/sample.rkt

Unify parameters, esp. plot3d-samples

Style:
 - 102 spaces wide
 - Comments
 - Avoid (all-defined-out)
 - 1-2-line module purpose statements

Outer contour intervals should never be zero-length

Join contour lines

Make defparam produce an applicable struct macro that contains docs


2D only
-------
Plot types
 - Simple 1D KDE
 - 1D KDE using FFT

Manually exclude discontinuous points in function/parametric?
Allow line functions to return (hole p1 p2), (left-hole p1 p2) or (right-hole p1 p2)?

histogram-list (use parameter for x-min)


3D only
-------
Subdivide nonlinearly transformed lines/polys

Decorations
 - labeled points
 - x/y/z axes?
 - tick grid?
 - polar axes/globe?

Graph types:
Histogram (vector a b height)
2-input parametric? (would have to divide polygons?)

Depth sorting
Bucket the sorted shapes and then sort by occlusion, default to min z first
Divide intersecting polygons? (have to figure out how to draw without a seam, or divide only when necessary)


Minor 2D and 3D
---------------
legend-entry contains minimum sizes?

Log ticks-funs (with base)

Label contour heights on the contour lines

Support for exact rational functions (test polynomial at [big..big+epsilon])


plot/custom
-----------
defproc/defparam for everything that is exposed

New modules
 - plot2d/bounds.rkt, plot3d/bounds.rkt
